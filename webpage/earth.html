            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by
            living things.
            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system
            with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
            planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
            Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.
            The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many
            names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Pop Culture</h3>
        <p>
            Storytellers explore the nature of our planet and possible alternate realities in many books, movies, and
            television shows. The iconic film "Planet of the Apes" (and its sequels) takes place in a future in which
            astronauts "discover" a planet inhabited by highly intelligent apes and primitive humans, only to realize
            later, much to their dismay, that – spoiler alert! – it was Earth all along.
            In the long-running and re-booted television series "Battlestar Galactica" – tired survivors of a war with
            highly evolved robots called Cylons are on a quest to find Earth, a long-lost colony.
            In other stories, Earth has been abandoned or destroyed, such as in the Joss Whedon series "Firefly," or the
            book and its film adaptation "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In the animated feature "Titan A.E." –
            Earth has been destroyed by an alien species, but a well-placed planet builder recreates it and all the
            species that live on it.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Kid-Friendly Earth</h3>
        <p>
            Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains,
            valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70%
            of Earth's surface.
            Earth's atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere
            also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up before they can hit the surface.
