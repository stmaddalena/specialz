            The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's
            Moon.
            From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from
            Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury
            is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense
            atmosphere.
            Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise
            briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at
            sunset.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Pop Culture</h3>
        <p>
            The smallest planet in our solar system has a big presence in our collective imagination. Scores of science
            fiction writers have been inspired by Mercury, including Isaac Asimov, C. S. Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C.
            Clarke, and H. P. Lovecraft. Television and film writers, too, have found the planet an ideal location for
            storytelling. In the animated television show "Invader Zim," Mercury is turned into a prototype giant
            spaceship by the extinct Martians. And in the 2007 film "Sunshine," the Icarus II spacecraft goes into orbit
            around Mercury to rendezvous with the Icarus I.
            In the comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes," Calvin and his classmate Susie give a presentation about Mercury, in
            which Calvin's contribution is full of questionable information: "The planet Mercury was named after a Roman
            god with winged feet," says Calvin. "Mercury was the god of flowers and bouquets, which is why today he is a
            registered trademark of FTD florists. Why they named a planet after this guy, I can't imagine."

        <h3 class="mt-5">Kid-Friendly Mercury</h3>
        <p>
            Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s a little bigger than Earth’s Moon. It is the
            closest planet to the Sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
            Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is
            covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes
            to keep things simple.
            Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make
            one full rotation. But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it goes
            around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
