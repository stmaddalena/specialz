            Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found
            the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.
            Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as
            massive as all the other planets combined.
            Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an
            atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that
            has raged for hundreds of years.
            One spacecraft – NASA's Juno orbiter – is currently exploring this giant world.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Pop Culture</h3>
        <p>
            The biggest planet in our solar system, Jupiter also has a large presence in pop culture, including many
            movies, TV shows, video games, and comics. Jupiter was a notable destination in the Wachowski siblings’
            science fiction spectacle "Jupiter Ascending," while various Jovian moons provide settings for "Cloud
            Atlas," "Futurama," "Power Rangers," and "Halo," among many others. In the movie "Men in Black" when Agent J
            – played by Will Smith – mentions he thought one of his childhood teachers was from Venus, Agent K – played
            by Tommy Lee Jones – replies that she is actually from one of Jupiter’s moons.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Kid-Friendly Jupiter</h3>
        <p>
            Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big enough to
            start burning.
            Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been
            going for hundreds of years.
            Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size
            of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.
