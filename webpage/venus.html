            Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four
            inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and
            density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
            Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick,
            yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest
            planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are
            about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color
            and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s
            possible some volcanoes are still active.
            Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure
            you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Pop Culture</h3>
        <p>
            Because it’s so bright and easy to see in the sky, Venus has played a role in popular culture since ancient
            times, inspiring writing and song:
            It was called the most beautiful star in the sky by Homer, author of "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" – two of
            the oldest and most important works in Greek literature.
            More recently, Venus became a popular venue for 20th-century science fiction writers, including Edgar Rice
            Burroughs (“Pirates of Venus,” 1934); Arthur C. Clarke (“Before Eden,” 1961); and C.S. Lewis (“Perelandra,”
            1943).
            Australian author Shirley Hazzard won the 1980 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction with her book,
            “The Transit of Venus,” about two orphaned sisters. American author John Gray used the planet and its
            masculine counterpart to explain relationships in his 1992 book “Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.”
            A song called “Venus” was teen idol Frankie Avalon’s first No. 1 hit when it topped the Billboard Hot 100
            chart in 1959. A decade later, a different song called “Venus" by the Dutch rock band Shocking Blue topped
            the charts in several countries. In 1986, British pop group Bananarama had a No. 1 hit in the U.S. with
            their cover of the song.
            More recently, Venus has been a backdrop for video games such as Transhuman Space, Battlezone, and Destiny.
            And in the Disney animated film “The Princess and the Frog,” Ray the firefly falls in love with Venus, “the
            evening star,” as he has mistaken it for another firefly.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Kid-Friendly Venus</h3>
        <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is
            closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is full of the
            greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid. The atmosphere traps heat, making it feel
            like a furnace on the surface. It’s so hot on Venus, the metal lead would melt.
            Venus is sometimes called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and structure, but the planets are very
            different in other ways. In addition to being extremely hot, Venus is unusual because it spins in the
            opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. It also has a very slow rotation making its day longer
            than its year.
