            ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is
            also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was
            even more active in the past.
            Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent
            rovers to roam the alien landscape.
            NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
            (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.
            Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on Mars
            on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The
            Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.
            Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab
            Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an
            orbiter, a lander, and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from orbit.
            In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land successfully on Mars when its Zhurong Mars rover
            touched down.
            An international fleet of eight orbiters is studying the Red Planet from above including three NASA
            orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN.
            These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker
            atmosphere, billions of years ago.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Pop Culture</h3>
        <p>
            No other planet has captured our collective imagination quite like Mars.
            In the late 1800s when people first observed the canal-like features on Mars' surface, many speculated that
            an intelligent alien species resided there. This led to numerous stories about Martians, some of whom invade
            Earth, like in the 1938 radio drama, "The War of the Worlds." According to an enduring urban legend, many
            listeners believed the story to be real news coverage of an invasion, causing widespread panic.
            Countless stories since have taken place on Mars or explored the possibilities of its Martian inhabitants.
            Movies like "Total Recall" (1990 and 2012) take us to a terraformed Mars and a struggling colony running out
            of air. A Martian colony and Earth have a prickly relationship in "The Expanse" television series and
            novels.
            And in the 2014 novel and its 2015 movie adaptation, "The Martian," botanist Mark Watney is stranded alone
            on the planet and struggles to survive until a rescue mission can retrieve him.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Kid-Friendly Mars</h3>
        <p>
            Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red
            because of rusty iron in the ground.
            Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere
            made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
            There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some
            Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.
